### Cost Function
The cost a postive integer *m* for *m > 1* is defined as the minimum of C<sub>S</sub>(a)+C<sub>S</sub>(b) such that *a* and *b* are positive integers and *m = a * b* for a binary operation * &in; S. C<sub>S</sub>(1) = 1. This function is similar to Komgorov complixities, however this function is computable.
